# Instrumenta Powerpoint Toolbar

### Updates to Orignial Version
* Uses *last selected object* as reference for several alignment actions such as "Align Centers", "Align Middles", "Align Left" etc.

Many strategy consultancy firms have proprietary Powerpoint add-ins that provide access to often used tools and features that help to quickly fine tune a powerpoint presentation. After spending 10 years in strategy consulting and joining 'the industry' myself, I was looking for an alternative for the add-ins I was used to. Although lots of commercial options are available, I could not find a free and open source alternative. 

As a spare time project in times of COVID-19, I decided to create Instrumenta as a free and open source consulting powerpoint toolbar. The ultimate goal is to create a feature rich toolbar that is compatible with both Windows and Mac versions of Microsoft Office. MIT-licensed, and use at your own risk.

# Platform support
All functions tested in Windows on the latest Office at that moment in time.

The add in will work in OS X, with some minor issues:
* Some icons are not the same as in the Windows-version. Microsoft Office does not support all icons from Windows on the Mac platform.
* *Lock and unlock position of objects on slide* is not supported. This method is not (yet) implemented in VBA for Powerpoint on Mac. However, shapes that have been 'locked' in Windows will be shown as 'locked' on Mac as well.
* *Export to E-mail (as PPT or PDF)*, *Export storyline to Word* and *Export slide notes to Word* are supported but require installation of an AppleScript-file due to OS X sandbox. See installation instructions below.

# How to install 
Instrumenta is a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) add-in that can be installed within Powerpoint, requiring no administrative rights on most enterprise systems.

## Windows
You can save the add-in to your PC and then install the add-in by adding it to the Available Add-Ins list:
- Download the add-in file in the latest release (https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/releases/download/1.27/InstrumentaPowerpointToolbar.ppam) or the latest beta (https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/raw/main/bin/InstrumentaPowerpointToolbar.ppam) and save it in a fixed location
- Open Powerpoint, click the File tab, and then click Options
- In the Options dialog box, click Add-Ins.
- In the Manage list at the bottom of the dialog box, click PowerPoint Add-ins, and then click Go.
- In the Add-Ins dialog box, click Add New.
- In the Add New PowerPoint Add-In dialog box, browse for the add-in file, and then click OK.
- A security notice appears. Click Enable Macros, and then click Close. 
  - Note: If you cannot enable Macros in this dialog, please refer to [these](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/a-potentially-dangerous-macro-has-been-blocked-0952faa0-37e7-4316-b61d-5b5ed6024216) instructions from Microsoft to unblock Instrumenta: (1) Open Windows File Explorer and go to the folder where you saved the file; (2) Right-click the file and choose Properties from the context menu; (3) At the bottom of the General tab, select the Unblock checkbox and select OK.
- There now should be an "Instrumenta" page in the Powerpoint ribbon

(Instructions based on https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-load-a-powerpoint-add-in-3de8bbc2-2481-457a-8841-7334cd5b455f)

## Mac
You can save the add-in to your Mac and then install the add-in by adding it to the Add-Ins list:
- Download the add-in file in the latest release (https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/releases/download/1.27/InstrumentaPowerpointToolbar.ppam) or the latest beta (https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/raw/main/bin/InstrumentaPowerpointToolbar.ppam) and save it in a fixed location
- Open Powerpoint, click Tools in the application menu, and then click Add-ins...
- In the Add-Ins dialog box, click the + button, browse for the add-in file, and then click Open.
- Click Ok to close the Add-ins dialog box
- There now should be an "Instrumenta" page in the Powerpoint ribbon

Additional optional steps to enable export to Outlook and Word:
- Download the AppleScript file (https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/releases/download/1.27/InstrumentaAppleScriptPlugin.applescript) 
- Copy the AppleScript file to *~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Powerpoint/*
- Please note that this is in the library folder of the *current user*. If the folder does not exist, create it.
- In some cases a reboot of your Mac might be required

The AppleScript file will not change that often, only in case of major changes to the export features, or new features that require the use of AppleScript. In that case Instrumenta can detect if the latest version of the file is installed and will inform you when using a feature that requires an updated version.

## Upgrade
To upgrade make sure Powerpoint is closed and overwrite the add-in file with the new version. 

### Upgrading from version < 1.0 to version 1.0 or higher
Please know that all versions before the first major release (v1.0) have a different filename. If you are upgrading to v1.0 please remove the old add-in first in the Add-ins dialog box in Powerpoint and then install the new version as mentioned above.
